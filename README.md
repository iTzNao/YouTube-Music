‚≠ê Star me on GitHub - it motivates me a lot!

YouTube Music is your all-in-one music companion, designed to revolutionize the way you experience and interact with music. With a seamless blend of cutting-edge features and intuitive design, this app offers a comprehensive music playback experience like no other. I made this because YouTube is too lazy to make their own app, consider this the official un-official app for YouTube Music.
